Biqing Qi is currently a XingQi Researcher at the Shanghai AI Lab. He received his Ph.D. from the Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems [(AIUS)](https://aius.hit.edu.cn/12888/list.htm) at Harbin Institute of Technology, under the joint supervision of the Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence  [(C3I)](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/)  at Tsinghua University, guided by Professors [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Ligang Wu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang). He serves as committee members for the Construction and Development of the National Supply Chain AI Application Platform and the Embodied Intelligence Committee of the Chinese Information Processing Society, with his research focusing on machine learning theory, foundational models, and human-machine collaborative systems.
His research has contributed to over 40 publications in top-tier conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, NAACL, TPAMI, TNNLS, and TCSVT. His contributions include: 1) Co-developing the "General-Specialized Integration Intelligence" pathway for AGI with Professor Zhou Bowen's team; 2) Introducing the concept and framework of interactive continual learning from the perspectives of System 1 and System 2; and 3) Pioneering the validation of a research paradigm for independent hypothesis generation driven by large language models (LLMs). His work has garnered significant media attention and has been implemented in leading technology companies such as Tencent, ByteDance, and Xianyuan.
Additionally, he has played a pivotal role in more than ten major projects, including two under the Ministry of Science and Technology's 2030 Key Special Project, two major R&D initiatives, and several key projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation. He has led a Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission project.
