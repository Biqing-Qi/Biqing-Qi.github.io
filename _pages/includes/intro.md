I'm a research scientist at the Shanghai AI Lab. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems [(AIUS)](https://aius.hit.edu.cn/12888/list.htm) at Harbin Institute of Technology, with joint supervision from the Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence [(C3I)](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/) at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Ligang Wu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang). 

My research has contributed to over 30 papers at top-tier conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, CVPR, ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, NAACL, TNNLS, TCSVT, and others. 

Additionally, I've played a pivotal role in more than ten significant projects, including two under the Ministry of Science and Technology's 2030 Key Special Project, two major R&D initiatives, and several key projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundations.

My research interests include: 1) trustworthy and continual learning theory, 2) knowledge-compositional foundation models（Specialized Generalist）, and 3) multimodal human-AI collaboration systems.
