I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. with the Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems [(AIUS)](https://aius.hit.edu.cn/12888/list.htm) in Control Science and Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, jointly supervised by the Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence [(C3I)](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/) at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Ligang Wu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang). 

Additionally, I collaborate closely with [Jianxing Liu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/jianxingliu), [Guanghui Sun](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/guanghuisun) at AIUS, and [Weinan Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangweinan?lang=zh) at the [DT Group](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~dt/people/) in SCIR Lab. Since February 2022, I have been interning at Frontis.AI in China.

My research interests include: 1) trustworthy and Interactive continual learning theory, 2) knowledge-compositional foundation models; 3) Multimodal human-AI collaboration systems and has contributed to over 30 papers (with 14 as the first author or corresponding author) published and submitted to top conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, CVPR, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, TNNLS. etc. Additionally, he has applied for four patents, with one already granted. As a core participant, he has been involved in more than ten key projects, including two projects under the Ministry of Science and Technology's 2030 Key Special Project, two major R&D projects, the National Outstanding Youth project, and several key projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, among others.
