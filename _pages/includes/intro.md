Biqing Qi is currently a XingQi Researcher at the Shanghai AI Lab and Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), collaborating with Professor [Yi Ma](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/mayi). He received his Ph.D. from the Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems [(AIUS)](https://aius.hit.edu.cn/12888/list.htm) at Harbin Institute of Technology, under the joint supervision of the Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence  [(C3I)](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/)  at Tsinghua University, guided by Professors [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Ligang Wu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang). 
He serves as a Member of the Technology Center at the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), a CommitteeMember for the National Supply Chain AI Application Platform, and a Member of the Embodied IntelligenceCommittee of the Chinese Information Processing Society.
His research focuses on machine learning and natural language processing. He has published over 60 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, CVPR, ACL, and TPAMI, of which more than 20 are first-author or corresponding-author publications. 
Key contributions include: 1) Co-proposing the "General-Specialized Integration Intelligence" pathway towards AGI with Prof. Bowen Zhou's team, developing dynamic architectures such as Nirvana, and advancing hardware-software co-design and early stroke screening—work covered by People's Daily; 2) Proposing an interactive continual learning framework and the SDAR model, establishing a leading open-source implementation;
3) Pioneering the early validation of LLM-driven autonomous hypothesis generation, building the MARTI multi-agent training-inference system, and achieving significant breakthroughs in computational chemistry. His work has garnered significant media attention and has been implemented in leading technology companies such as Tencent, ByteDance, and Xianyuan. He has led two national major projects, one Shanghai municipal major project and one project under the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
