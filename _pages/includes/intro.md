I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. with the Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems [(AIUS)](https://aius.hit.edu.cn/12888/list.htm) in Control Science and Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, jointly supervised by the Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence [(C3I)](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/) at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Ligang Wu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wuligang). 

Additionally, I collaborate closely with [Jianxing Liu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/jianxingliu), [Guanghui Sun](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/guanghuisun) at AIUS, and [Weinan Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangweinan?lang=zh) at the [DT Group](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~dt/people/) in SCIR Lab. Since February 2022, I have been interning at Frontis.AI in China.

My research interests include: 1) trustworthy and interactive continual learning theory, 2) knowledge-compositional foundation models, and 3) multimodal human-AI collaboration systems.

If you are eeking any form of academic collaborations with AIUS, SCIR Lab at HIT, Tsinghua C3I Lab, or the Shanghai AI Lab, please feel free to email me at [qibiqing7@gmail.com](qibiqing@gmail.com).
